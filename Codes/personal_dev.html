            	<h2>Summary and Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" (Chapters 4-7)</h2>
            	<p>In Chapters 4-7 of <i>Twelve Pillars</i>, Jim Rohn and Chris Widener emphasize personal growth, discipline, and the power of relationships in achieving success. The book highlights that success is not accidentalâ€”it results from intentional habits, strong principles, and continuous learning.</p>
            	<p>One key takeaway is the importance of lifelong learning. The book encourages constant self-education, which resonates with my academic journey in Computing. Just as I strive to master programming and problem-solving, the book teaches that self-improvement is an ongoing process. Another significant lesson is the value of surrounding oneself with positive influences. Building a strong network of mentors and like-minded individuals can propel one toward success.</p>
            	<p>I plan to apply these lessons by continuously refining my skills, seeking mentorship, and maintaining a disciplined approach to my studies and career goals.</p>
